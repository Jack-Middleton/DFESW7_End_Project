<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Why are we doing this 

During the DfE Software Pathway with QA, we covered Java, SpringBoot and MySQL amongst other things, and to finish off all of this learning we were tasked with creating a fully functioning API, with CRUD functionality, fully designed test suites and documentation. 
I decided to create a Recipe storage system, using JPA for the repository, H2 for the on-memory database for development and testing and then persisted the data in MySQL, and used Postman to send requests to my API to check functionality. 

<details>
<summary>The MVP targets for this project were</summary>
<ol>
  <ul>Code fully integrated into a Version Control System using the feature-branch model: **main/dev/multiple features**</ul>
  <ul>A project management board with full expansion on user stories, accpetance criteria and tasks needed to complete the project</ul>
  <ul>A risk assessment which outlines the issues and risks faced during the project timeframe</ul>
  <ul>A relational database, locally or within the Cloud, which is used to persist data for the project.</ul>
  <ul>A functional application ‘back-end’, written in a suitable framework of the language covered in training (Java/Spring Boot), which meets the requirements set on your Jira board. </ul>
  <ul>A build (.jar) of your application, including any dependencies it might need, produced using an integrated build tool (Maven). </ul>
  <ul>A series of API calls designed with postman, used for CRUD functionality. (Create, Read, Update, Delete) </ul>
  <ul>Fully designed test suites for the application you are creating, including both **unit** and **integration tests**. </ul>
 </ol>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### How I expected the challenge to go

I Honestly came in to this expecting it to be incredibly stressful and difficult, picturing myself struggling at every hurdle. 
Which, while it isn't too far from what happened, once I dealt with app install issues things slowly started to piece themselves together using QA community, discussions with the trainers and some hefty use of stack overflow. 


### What went well

The CRUD functionality was fairly simple enough to implement, ran in to a few serialization errors but it was a simple case of missing annotations. 
Setting up Jira and Git went fairly smoothly and I felt like I made pretty good pace for the project, hitting all but 4 of the MVP targets within the first couple of days (with a few late nights thrown in but y'know)
